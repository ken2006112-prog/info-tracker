          # Or user can just put the webhook inside CONFIG_YAML.
          # But providing a separate secret is safer/easier for some.
          # For simplicity, let's assume user puts the webhook INSIDE CONFIG_YAML.
          # So no change needed here actually, unless we want to force it.
          # Let's keep it simple: User edits config.yaml locally, pastes webhook, then copies content to secret.
